BE THOU WARNED

This game was made in FORTY EIGHT HOURS.  All the graphics, all the code, all the sounds.  It is a horrendous shambles of a facade of a video game and should not serve as an example of how to do anything ever.

ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE

If you think you can handle it, this is the source code for a top-down 2D action-adventure game, in the vein of the classic Zelda games.  It has a big map, a scrolling/locking camera, and some very dumb enemies.  The code is not really commented much, though I try to use descriptive variable names when possible, and use some basic object-oriented organization for the sake of sanity.  Enjoy!
